Bitcoin Lightning Wallet
------------------------

## Project state

After some years without updates the wallet stopped working, but I've fixed
several bugs and now it's usable again.

Use it at you own risk.

## Dependencies

To fetch fiat and mempool rates and also calculate lightning routes, you must
connect to a server, [Golympus](http://github.com/mrbitcoiner/golympus) can do
that for you.

## Building

For now, there's no build instructions, but when your development ambient is 
set with the right dependency versions, a ```./gradlew assebleDebug``` should 
work.

## Contributing

Feel free to open a pull request, but this is not my full time job, be 
respectful.

## Acknowledgments

A huge thanks for the project creator, Anton Kumaigorodski.

This wallet uses modified code from [Eclair](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair)
project.
